Hello guys.!
Today I will will set up a COPYBOT!.
The COPYBOT is a slave of the master bot. It will follow its master around and copy everything it does.
This can also be called a “Master- Slave Robot” project.

I’ve used here one master robot and one slave robot. However after completion of this project, you can attach as many slave robots with the master robot.

COMPONENTS REQUIRED ->

1x Arduino uno
1x Bluetooth Module (I used HC-05)
2x Chassis
2x Breadboard
1x RF transmitter Module
1x RF receiver module
4x Wheels
4x Motors – (100 rpm DC motor)
2x 9v batteries
2x L293D (Motor driver IC)
   A lot of connecting wires
For controlling your master robot wirelessly, you need a remote. You can turn your phone into an IR remote by building a simple app in MIT app inventor. For novice’s, here is the link where you can learn how to build the app.
